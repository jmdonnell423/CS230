Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was the client and wanted me to create a gaming platform to run their game according to some specific requirements.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think my evaluation of which operating systems to use and why was very thorough. The differences in the operating systems from a cost analysis to 
a service analysis was detailed enough to explain why I was recommending the services that I did and still vague enough to allow the customer to make an
informative decision on their own.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It allowed me to think through the different strategies that would work for the program I was developing. Understanding that the situation in specific
was important to give an educated form of advice. If they wanted to develop a game with high definition graphics the advice would be different than
wanting to create a game that runs on a mobile system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Not having the ability to speak with the client about future goals or specific structures made it difficult to gage which avenue I should proceed with.
Maybe they didn't have plans to expand the way I thought they would, or maybe they had a specific goal in mind that I did not understand.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was able to fulfill the needs of the client for this particular project. The requirements were met using the requirements set forth by the customer in
the design document. UIsing the Executive summary and the requirements as a guide I was able to ensure that the clients goals were met effectively.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

First I needed to gather the requirements of the client. Afterwards I was able to organize that information and proceed to give appropriate advice based
on the information given by the customer. Using a template as a guide I was able to adapt the goals of the customer into the client-server template and
ensure the requirements were met with little to no interference or guess work.
